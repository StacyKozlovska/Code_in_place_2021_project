# Code_in_place_2021_project

This is the final project for Code in Place 2021 course by Stanford University. This Python code helps you find
an optimized route to visit all your destination points and return back to the starting point. Bing Maps API was
used to solve the traveling salesman problem and visualize the optimized route on the map. Also, the code prints
out a list of links to web pages with Covid-19 travel restrictions for each destination country.
